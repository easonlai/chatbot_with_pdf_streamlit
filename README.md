# Chatbot with PDF for Semantic Search over Documents (Build with Streamlit, LangChain, Pinecone/Chroma/Azure Cognitive Search)

This repository contains a code example for how to build an interactive chatbot for semantic search over documents. The chatbot allows users to ask natural language questions and get relevant answers from a collection of documents. The chatbot uses [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for web and chatbot interface, [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), and leverages various types of vector databases, such as [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/), and [Azure Cognitive Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search)â€™s [Vector Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-overview), to perform efficient and accurate similarity search. The code is written in Python and can be easily modified to suit different use cases and data sources.
